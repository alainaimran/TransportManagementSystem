# TransportManagementSystem

ðŸ“„ Transport Management System â€” Manage Bookings Module
This project is part of a Transport Management System (TMS) developed as a learning exercise for my Software Development course. The system is designed to help users manage their transport bookings easily through a web-based interface.

ðŸ“Œ Manage Bookings Use Case
In this module, users can:

View Available Vehicles
See a list of available buses with their details.

View Route Details
Check the routes for each vehicle to know where it travels.

Select Vehicle & Book Journey
Choose a vehicle, select a seat, and confirm their booking.

This use case is an important part of the TMS project as it handles the booking operations between the user and the system, making it simple for users to manage their transport reservations.
